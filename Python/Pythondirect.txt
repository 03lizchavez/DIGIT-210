Honestly I hope I get better at learning some of the coding to Python because even with the
tutorials some things were confusing. But I can look back and play around with it, so I have a
better understanding. It just got confusing sometimes even with the link to further explain when
some things were not helpful because it'd go over stuff that was not learned until later.
